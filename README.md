# MSXI Firmware Archive

This repo stores a copy of the firmware used on MSXI. Branches are used to distinguish between each board, keeping the commit history as it was when archived. A copy of each repo is also available as tarballs.

Note that this is considered archived and should not be modified. Active development should take place in the firmware repo.
