// This is responsible for managing the car's relays.
// Since relays are mechanical parts, they can fail.
//  Thus, the results of these functions must be verified when called.

// Relays have two components:
//  1) The relay itself (open when pin low, closed when pin high) (required)
//  2) The status pin used to verify relay state (low when relay open, high when closed) (optional)
//     If the status port is 0, it is assumed that the relay does not have a status pin.
